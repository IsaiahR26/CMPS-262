        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Isaiah Rodrigues. I am currently finishing up my bachelors degree
           in applied computer science in networking and security. In my spare time, I
           enjoy playing video games and listening to music. I have two other accounting
           courses that I'm taking right now and for this CMPS262 course I'm actually retaking it.
           I'm looking forward to learning how to properly apply the coding and see how
           everything works. I do actually have a bit more knowldege with github now that
           I completed CMPS480, so that should help me better understand what needs to be
           done here. Other than that I don't work anywhere and I enjoy helping out at home
           when I'm able to.
        </p>
